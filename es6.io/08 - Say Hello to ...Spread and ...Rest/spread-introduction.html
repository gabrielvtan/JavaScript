  // A spread operator takes every single item from an iterable and adds it to a given list, object, etc. 
  // An iterable is anything you can loop through with a for-of loop and that includes arrays, strings, DOM nodes, argument objects, maps, and sets 
  const featured = ['Deep Dish', 'Pepperoni', 'Hawaiian'];
  const specialty = ['Meatzza', 'Spicy Mama', 'Margherita'];

  // This also acceptable if you are simply adding together two different iterables 
  //   const pizzas = featured.concat(specialty);

  const pizzas = [...featured, 'veg', ...specialty];
  console.log(pizzas)

  // this is how you easily copy an array - we use the spread operator to copy each element 
  const fridayPizzas = [...pizzas];
  console.log(fridayPizzas);

  // sample string spread 
  const string = [...'Gabby']
  console.log(string);
