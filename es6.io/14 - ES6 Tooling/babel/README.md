# What is Babel?
- it's a JS compiler that converts ES6 to ES5
- it has expanded to future JS and React stuff 
- You need webpack if you are using modules within your application 
- `"babel": "babel app.js --watch --out-file app-complised.js"` should be added to package.json in order to compile the code
