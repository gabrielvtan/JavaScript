  // which is the method that allows you to instantiate a class

    // Dog.info() - not snickers.info()

    // this is not a method - it is just a property you can put on the class

    // this is a setter to set a value on a given object

    // and here we can now get the nickname of a given dog 
    get nicknames() {
      return this.nick.toUpperCase();
    }
  }

  const snickers = new Dog('Snickers', 'King Charles');
