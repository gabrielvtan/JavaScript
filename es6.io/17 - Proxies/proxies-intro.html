  // A proxy allows you to overwrite the default behavior for many of an object's default operations
  // Here is an example of how we can return a different object other than the name Gabby by creating a Proxy
  // Proxy takes two arguments, first is the 'target' which is the object you'd like to change
  // second is the 'handler' which is where you specify all of the operations which you wish to rewrite 
  // each action you have within the 'handler' is called a trap which is the method you can do to a given object
  const person = { name: 'Gabby', age: 100 };
  const personProxy = new Proxy(person, {
    get(target, name) {
      // console.log('someone is asking for ', target, name);
      return target[name].toUpperCase();
    },
    set(target, name, value) {
      if(typeof value === 'string') {
        target[name] = value.trim().toUpperCase() + '✂️';
      }
    }
  });

  
  personProxy.name = 'Gabriel is sooooo cooollll     ';
