  // the ...rest param does the exact opposite in that it packs multiple elements into a single array 
  // in this example, the amounts become the last 3 arguments of convertCurrency
  function convertCurrency(rate, tax, tip, ...amounts) {
    console.log(rate, tax, tip, amounts);
    return amounts.map(amount => amount * rate);
  }

  const amounts = convertCurrency(1.54, 10, 23, 52, 1, 56);
  console.log(amounts);

  // This is similar to the destructuring example we did earlier 
  const runner = ['Wes Bos', 123, 5.5, 5, 3, 6, 35];
  const [name, id, ...runs] = runner;
  console.log(name, id, runs);

  const team = ['Wes', 'Kait', 'Lux', 'Sheena', 'Kelly'];
  const [captain, assistant, ...players] = team;
  console.log(captain, assistant, players)
